# Oráculo - Permissionless Prediction Markets on Solana

![Oráculo Banner](./docs/banner.png)

**Pump.fun for Prediction Markets** — Create, trade, and resolve ANY prediction market in 60 seconds on Solana.

🏆 **Built for Solana Cypherpunk Hackathon 2025**

## 🌟 Overview

Oráculo introduces a revolutionary **DAO-as-Oracle** architecture where the same governance token holders who create markets also resolve them, eliminating the centralized oracle problem that plagues existing prediction market platforms.

### Key Features

- 🚀 **Truly Permissionless**: Anyone can create markets without approval
- 🏛️ **DAO-as-Oracle + Issuer**: Novel futarchy-style governance 
- ⚡ **Solana Speed**: 400ms finality, $0.00025 per transaction
- 💧 **Bonding Curves**: Instant liquidity via constant product formula
- 🔒 **Proof of Liquidity**: Anti-rug mechanism with locked creator funds
- 🗳️ **Stake-Weighted Voting**: 66% supermajority + 10K token quorum
- 🔮 **Future zkTLS**: Reclaim Protocol integration planned for Q1 2026

## 📊 Market Opportunity

- **TAM**: $95.5B by 2035 (CAGR 46.8%)
- **Current Leader**: Polymarket ($1B+ monthly volume, centralized)
- **Problem**: Centralized resolution, high fees, geographic restrictions
- **Solution**: Fully decentralized DAO resolution on Solana

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Rust/Anchor 0.31.1)
```
programs/
├── oraculo/          # Main prediction market program
│   ├── state/        # Market, Proposal, VoteRecord, Config
│   ├── instructions/ # Create, Bet, Propose, Vote, Execute, Claim
│   ├── errors.rs     # Custom error codes
│   └── utils.rs      # Bonding curve calculations
└── governance-token/ # Governance token program
```

**Key Instructions:**
- `create_market`: Create market with Proof of Liquidity (min 100 USDC locked)
- `place_bet`: Buy YES/NO tokens via bonding curve
- `propose_resolution`: Propose outcome (1K token stake required)
- `vote_on_resolution`: Stake-weighted voting
- `execute_resolution`: Settlement after 48h + quorum met
- `claim_winnings`: Redeem winning tokens 1:1 for USDC

### Frontend (Next.js 15 + TypeScript)
```

├── app/              # Pages (landing, markets, governance, portfolio)
├── components/       # UI components (glassmorphism + neural effects)
├── lib/

│   ├── solana/       # Anchor setup, constants, IDL
│   └── utils/        # Formatting, calculations, helpers
```

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 15 (React 19)
- Reown AppKit for wallet connections
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- Framer Motion for animations
- Recharts for bonding curve visualization
- Tailwind CSS + Glassmorphism

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Rust 1.75+
- Solana CLI 1.18+
- Anchor 0.31.1

### Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/oraculo
cd oraculo

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build programs
anchor build

# Update Program IDs
# Copy program IDs from target/deploy/*.json to:
# - programs/*/src/lib.rs (declare_id!)
# - Anchor.toml

# Rebuild with correct IDs
anchor build

# Deploy to devnet
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet

# Initialize protocol
pnpm run initialize

# Seed demo markets
pnpm run seed

# Start frontend
cd app
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

### Environment Variables
Create `app/.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROGRAM_ID=oRAC1e... # From deployment
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOVERNANCE_TOKEN_MINT=GovXXX... # From deployment

## 🧪 Testing
```bash
# Run Anchor tests
anchor test

# Run with coverage
pnpm run test:coverage

# Frontend tests
cd app
pnpm run lint
pnpm run type-check
```

## 📖 How It Works

### 1. Market Creation (Permissionless)
```typescript
// Anyone can create a market with:
- Question (max 200 chars)
- Description (max 500 chars)
- Category (Crypto, Sports, Politics, etc.)
- End time (max 1 year future)
- Resolution source (optional URL for future zkTLS)
- Initial liquidity (min 100 USDC - locked as anti-rug)
```

### 2. Betting (Bonding Curve)
- Formula: x * y = k (constant product)
- YES_pool and NO_pool start equal (50/50)
- Price discovery via AMM mechanics
- No slippage limits (pure market forces)
- Instant liquidity, no order books

### 3. Resolution (DAO Optimistic)
After market ends:

**Proposal Phase**: Anyone stakes 1,000 governance tokens + proposes outcome
**Voting Phase**: 48-hour voting window
- Token holders vote with stake-weighted power
- Votes locked during period

**Execution Phase**:
- Requires 10,000 token quorum
- Requires 66% supermajority
- Correct proposers rewarded, wrong ones slashed 50%

**Settlement**: Winning tokens redeem 1:1 for USDC

### 4. Security Mechanisms
- **Proof of Liquidity**: Creator funds locked until resolution
- **Slashing**: 50% stake penalty for incorrect proposals
- **Quorum**: Prevents attacks with low participation
- **Supermajority**: 66% threshold prevents 51% attacks
- **Time locks**: 7-day resolution window after market end
