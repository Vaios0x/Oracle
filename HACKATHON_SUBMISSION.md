# Oráculo - Hackathon Submission

## One-Liner
**Pump.fun for prediction markets — First DAO-as-Oracle architecture on Solana enabling truly permissionless market creation and resolution in 60 seconds.**

## 50-Word Description
Oráculo revolutionizes prediction markets with a novel DAO-as-Oracle model where governance token holders simultaneously create AND resolve markets. Built on Solana with bonding curves for instant liquidity, Proof of Liquidity anti-rug mechanism, and 400ms settlement. Future zkTLS integration via Reclaim Protocol planned for Q1 2026.

## Track
**DeFi** (Primary)

## What We Built
Complete permissionless prediction market platform with:
1. Solana smart contracts (Rust/Anchor) - 7 core instructions
2. Governance token program for DAO voting
3. Next.js 15 frontend with glassmorphism UI
4. Reown AppKit wallet integration
5. Bonding curve AMM for instant liquidity
6. DAO resolution with stake-weighted voting
7. 10+ seeded demo markets on devnet

## Why It Matters
- **Market Size**: $95.5B by 2035 (46.8% CAGR)
- **Problem**: Polymarket does $1B+/month but is centralized; UMA is decentralized but costs $5-50/tx
- **Solution**: Truly decentralized DAO resolution on Solana at $0.00025/tx
- **Innovation**: First futarchy-style architecture where DAO is simultaneously oracle AND market issuer

## Technical Highlights
- Proof of Liquidity: Creator funds locked as anti-rug (100 USDC minimum)
- Bonding curves: x*y=k constant product for price discovery
- Slashing: 50% stake penalty for incorrect oracle proposals
- Supermajority: 66% + 10K quorum prevents attacks
- Compute optimized: <50K CU per instruction

## What's Next
With Colosseum accelerator funding ($250K):
1. Professional audit (Zellic)
2. zkTLS integration (Reclaim Protocol) 
3. Mainnet beta launch
4. Mobile app (Saga dApp Store)
5. Target: 1K DAU, $1M daily volume by Q2 2026

## Built With
Solana, Anchor, Rust, Next.js 15, TypeScript, Reown AppKit, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Recharts
